Project Overview

This project aims to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset of Shark Tank India Season 1. Shark Tank India is a reality show where entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of investors (sharks) to secure funding. The goal of this project is to understand the patterns, trends, and insights from the data related to the pitches, the entrepreneurs, the investments, and the sharks.

1. Pitches: Details about the products or services presented by the entrepreneurs.
2. Entrepreneurs: Information about the individuals or teams presenting the pitches.
3. Sharks: Details about the investors, including the deals they made.
4. Investments: Data on the investments made, including the amounts and equity offered.
